====================================================
![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/AmmarCSE/mvc-calendar/master/screenshot.png)
MVCCalendar is based on the FullCalendar jQuery plugin and extends it with
MVC capabilities. You can now attach a model to each day in your calendar and
provide different views allowing users model editing capabilities.

Getting Set Up
--------------

You will need two third party libraries to get MVCCalendar up and running. The
first is jQuery(any version) and the second is the FullCalendar
library.Afterwards you can use the controller router and basic model and view
objects provided by MVCCalendar to build a calendar with custom models and
views.
