MVCCalendar - Model-View-Controller FullCalendar
====================================================
![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/AmmarCSE/mvc-calendar/master/screenshot.png)

MVCCalendar is based on the FullCalendar jQuery plugin and extends it with
MVC capabilities. You can now attach a model to each day in your calendar and
provide different views allowing users model editing capabilities.

Getting Set Up
--------------

You will need two 3rd party libraries to get MVCCalendar up and running. The
first is jQuery(any version) and the second is the FullCalendar
library. Afterwards you can use the controller router and basic model and view
objects provided by MVCCalendar to build a calendar with custom models and
views. Please refer to the documentation file for further instructions on use and capabilities.

Examples
--------------

Two examples are provided to display the use and capabilities of MVCCalendar. The first shows a very basic use of MVCCalendar with a model depicting hotel room allotments by day. No options are used and only one calendar is live on the page.
The second example depicts a more advanced use of MVCCalendar with multiple live calendars on the same page and various options used such as holidays and pre-loaded data.

ToDo
--------------
Phase out use of FullCalendar plugin in order to allow cleaner seperation of views and controller.

Implement example with multiple calendars and more advanced options. 

Format and place comments in code.
